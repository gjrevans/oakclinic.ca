    "about": "Dr. Anouk Chaumont graduated from the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine in 2005 and practiced naturopathic medicine in Eastern Ontario for 9 years before deciding to move to Grande Prairie, Alberta. During her career as a naturopathic doctor, she has had a special interest in naturopathic oncology as well as injection therapy for musculoskeletal problems.\n\nIn the recent years, after her husband got bitten by a tick in Northern Alberta and contracted Lyme disease and Babesiosis (a co-infection often transmitted by ticks), Dr Chaumont has decided to focus her career in helping patients suffering from Lyme disease and associated tick-borne infections. Although she still practices general family naturopathic medicine, the main focus of her practice is in the proper diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease as well as naturopathic oncology support.\n\nShe uses functional medicine as well as botanical medicine as her foundational therapeutic approach. Most of her therapeutic recommendations are highly science-based and are usually accompanied by individualized lifestyle and nutritional modifications. Finding the underlying root cause of disease is her passion and fixing it with the least amount of pharmaceuticals as possible is her goal.",
